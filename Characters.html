			<p>Meliodas (メリオダス, Meriodasu)
Voiced by: Yuki Kaji (Japanese); Bryce Papenbrook (English)
Meliodas is the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins, who bears the Sin of Wrath as a Dragon symbol on his left shoulder. Despite being called the Sin of Wrath, displaying it whenever those dear to him are endangered or killed, Meliodas conceals his rage under the façade of a mellow trickster who is often seen fondling Elizabeth one way or another. When found by Elizabeth at the start of the series, who seeks his help in reuniting the Deadly Sins after their disbandment ten years prior, Meliodas reveals to be doing the same thing. Despite his adolescent appearance, Meliodas is actually a demon who is over three thousand years old. Meliodas is later revealed to be the son of the Demon King and original leader of the Ten Commandments, possessing the fragment of his father's soul embodying Love.[vol. 34] But Meliodas turned his back on his people when he fell in love with the Goddess Elizabeth, killing two of his fellow Commandments and causing the Holy War to occur. The Demon King allowed the Supreme Deity of the Goddess race to curse Meliodas with immortality, with the Demon King cursing Elizabeth with perpetual death and reincarnation to make his son suffer every time he is reunited with her. Due to the curse's nature, Meliodas' soul ends up in Purgatory with the Demon King feasting on his emotions before reviving him, gradually reverting to his former self as a result.[vol. 24] Meliodas soon discovers his feelings for Elizabeth and ends up marrying her having one child named Tristan. Meliodas has two brothers, however both of his brothers fought for evil ending up siding with the demon king (their father). Meliodas has to fight his brothers in order to surpass his father.</p>

<p>After Elizabeth begins regaining her memories as the goddess Elizabeth which would mean that she will die in three days of gaining her memories, Meliodas resolves to become the new demon king to break their curses. He disbands the Deadly Sins and enters an alliance with Zeldris after promising to use his status to release his brother's love Gelda, revealing to have absorbed the Commandment of Pacifism and intending to absorb the other commandments. Despite becoming a vessel for the Demon King before managing to force him out of his body, Meliodas freed him and Elizabeth from their curses though he would leave the living world because his power as a Demon king. But the victory is short-lived as the Demon King possesses Zeldris and restores Elizabeth's curse, prompting the Sins' final battle with the Demon King.[vol. 38] After killing his father, Meliodas sacrifices his Demon king powers to completely destroy the commandments to prevent the Demon King from reviving. In the series epilogue, Meliodas married Elizabeth and become the rulers of Liones with Tristan as their son.</p>
<p>As Seven Deadly Sins' captain once revered by his kin as the most powerful demon, Meliodas is immensely powerful and agile. His signature ability is called Full Counter (全反撃フルカウンター, Furu Kauntā), which reflects magical attacks back at the attacker with far greater power, the only drawbacks being that he can only use it as a counter and that it is ineffective against physical attacks. Meliodas can also tap into his demonic power, manifesting versatile dark energy from his body to increase his offense and defense at the cost of entering a berserker state. Meliodas initially carried a sword hilt called the Dragon Handle before it was stolen by Helbram and later revealed to be a fragment of the Coffin of Eternal Darkness, which was used to seal away the Demon clan. He later regains his Sacred Treasure Demon Sword Lostvayne (魔剣 ロストヴェイン, Maken Rosutovein), a curved short-sword that allows him to create up to four weaker clones of himself that compensate for their lack in power by using Full Counter to its full potential.</p>

			<p>Diane (ディアンヌ, Diannu)
Voiced by: Aoi Yūki (Japanese); Erica Mendez (English)
Diane, standing thirty-feet tall, is a 750 year-old member of the Giants' Clan from the land of Megadoza, who bears the Sin of Envy, symbolized by a Serpent symbol tattooed on her left thigh. Unlike her more violent kinsmen who make a living as mercenaries, Diane dislikes fighting. Having run away from home, she came upon King by chance, and the two spent centuries together before he erased her memories of him, and she returned to her tribe soon after. She later became an apprentice of her chieftain Matrona, alongside Dolores, and accompanied Matrona when she was hired by a Holy Knight unit under the command of Gannon, who actually intended to kill the giants and make a name for himself. It ended with Matrona seemingly dying from being poisoned and slaughtering the knights with Diane ending up in Liones' custody and falsely accused of both the knights' slaughter and murdering Matrona in an act of envy. She was recruited by Meliodas before her execution could be carried out. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, Diane hid in the Forest of White Dreams before Meliodas and Elizabeth recruited her. Diane having feelings for the former for treating her like an equal and being initially jealous whenever he flirts with Elizabeth. But after being impressed with Elizabeth's selflessness before regaining her memories of her time with King, Diane becomes very good friends with Elizabeth. She eventually regains her childhood memories of King and forms a relationship with him, eventually getting married after the Deadly Sins disband despite the ceremony being disrupted by the Supreme Being's attempt to bring about a new Holy War.</p>
<p>As a Giant, Diane is incredibly strong with a deep connection to nature which allows her to manipulate the earth with her race's ability Creation (創造クリエイション, Kurieishon). Diane retains her strength and agility even when human-sized while participating in a fighting festival under Matrona's name, quickly defeating ten men and hardening her skin, thereby making it as hard as iron to enhance her durability and strength. Her sacred treasure is Gideon, a 2200 pound war-hammer that enhances Diane's earth manipulation powers to a point where a single swing can lift a mountain into the air.</p>

		<br>
			<p>Ban (バン)
Voiced by: Tatsuhisa Suzuki (Japanese); Ben Diskin (English)
Ban, is a member of the Deadly Sins and bears the Sin of Greed, symbolized by a Fox symbol tattooed above the left side of his waist. Despite being a good-natured person, he is the Sins' most immortal member and infamous as a legendary bandit. At times, the team thinks of him as annoying and very immature. He had taken to a life of thievery at a young age under the tutelage of Zhivago (for example he stole clothes). Years later, Ban learned of the Fountain of Youth and attempted to become immortal so he would live long enough for "something good to happen to him". However, Ban changed his mind when the fountain's guardian Elaine revealed the forest would die if he drank the liquid. He fell in love with the fairy over seven days. She was grateful for him, as her brother had left her alone for seven hundred years prior to meeting Ban. A red demon appeared soon after and in an attempt to kill it, Ban and Elaine were fatally wounded. However, Elaine saved Ban by giving him the liquid from the fountain through a kiss. As she was dying, she gave him an Almoca Seed, which he uses to create a new Sacred Tree. Ban was falsely accused by the Liones Kingdom of destroying and stealing from the previous fountain; he was later recruited by Meliodas after surviving numerous executions. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, Ban allowed himself to be captured and held captive within Baste Dungeon, which he escaped occasionally so he could tend to the Sacred Tree. He was later nicknamed “King Ban” by the fairy race for his actions. He eventually rejoins the Deadly Sins and serves as a cook in the Boar Hat, whilst getting into occasional confrontations with Meliodas and King. During the New Holy War, after returning from Purgatory with Meliodas' emotions, Ban uses his experience there to transfer his immortality into Elaine to save her life. n the series epilogue, Ban married Elaine and they have a son named Lancelot.</p>
<p>While immortal, unaffected by fatigue or need of sustenance, Ban can heal his body regardless of any severe wound with his blood have healing properties. While Ban sacrificed his immortality, his body became highly durable from his myriad of years in Purgatory's unforgiving environment. His trademark ability is Snatch (強奪スナッチ, Sunatchi), which allows him to rob others of their possessions and even physical abilities as he can temporarily sap another's physical strength and speed. Ban also shows some skill with weaponry in the present, particularly with a three-section staff very similar in appearance to a nunchaku. His sacred treasure Courechouse is a four-sectioned staff that was ironically stolen from him during the Deadly Sins' disbandment, the culprit revealed to be Merlin when she returned it to him during the final battle with the Demon King.</p>

			<p>King (キング, Kingu)
Voiced by: Jun Fukuyama (Japanese); Max Mittelman (English)
The fairy King, his real name being Fairy King Harlequin (妖精王 ハーレクイン, Yōseiō Hārekuin), is the 1300-year-old member of the Fairy Race who bears the Sin of Sloth, symbolized by Grizzly bear symbol tattooed just above his left ankle. He is portrayed as the group's 'straight man' while often getting caught up in the others' shenanigans. Originally the third king of the Fairy King's Forest, King forsook his duties when he left his domain to rescue his friend Helbram from human abductors and he was saved by Diane after being inflicted with amnesia-inducing injuries. Centuries after regaining his memories and realizing his amnesia was caused by a maddened Helbram, King is forced to kill his friend to cease his human killing spree. He then erased Diane's memories of him before being sentenced by Liones to a 1000-year imprisonment for failing to stop Helbram in time and abandoning his duties as king, with the Fairy King's Forest eventually being destroyed by a demon that would kill his sister Elaine. After joining the Seven Deadly Sins, King would occasionally disguise himself as a slovenly over-weighted man to keep Diane from remembering him. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, King finally learned of his homeland's destruction while believing Ban was responsible. He crosses paths with the Sins when they heard he took refuge in the Necropolis, reluctantly rejoining the group once learning the truth behind his sister's death. Despite Diane's affection towards Meliodas, King remains devoted to her as she eventually regains her memories of their time together.</p>
<p>Like members of the fairy race, King has the ability to levitate and float through the air, as well as being able to levitate certain objects and manipulate their trajectory without the need of making physical contact. King also possesses a sacred treasure called Spirit Spear, Chastiefol (霊槍シャスティフォル, Reisō Shasutiforu). A spear crafted from a sacred tree only found in the Fairy Realm, it is much stronger than steel and possesses the mysterious qualities of the tree, which King's ability, Disaster (災厄ディザスター, Dizasutā), draws out. At will, King can instantly change Chastiefol into one of several different forms, including a pillow which can act as a shield, different forms of spears (one of which can turn an enemy to stone), a massive flower sprouted from the earth that projects an enormous energy beam, and even a large stuffed grizzly bear. But despite his impressive magical abilities and able to move at speeds while in midair, King is physically weak and unable to hold his own in a fight while unarmed.
King was voted the most popular character by a large margin in a Weekly Shōnen Magazine character poll for the series, with close to four times as many votes as Ban, who came in second place.</p>

		<img src="Gowther.jpg" class="Gowther">

			<p>Gowther (ゴウセル, Gōseru)
Voiced by: Yuhei Takagi (Japanese); Erik Scott Kimerer (English)
Gowther is a member of the Deadly Sins who bears the Sin of Lust, symbolized by the Goat symbol tattooed above his breast; he is an androgynous and bespectacled bookworm with pink hair who originally clad himself in a massive suit of armor Merlin designed to stabilize his power due to his unstable mind. He is first seen as emotionless and analytically stoic while also very socially inept as his curiosity often has him performing highly questionable actions, such as manipulating the memories of others. At the time he was discovered, being a skilled actor when he feels like it, he was living under the alias Armand ("Alan" in the anime) and traveling with a Holy Knight named Dale whom he clad in his armor on to contain the knight's transformation into a demon.</p>
<p>Gowther is later revealed to be an animated doll created by his namesake, a demon sorcerer forced to bear the Demon King's soul fragment bearing Selflessness (無欲, Muyoku), which causes those inflicted by it to lose their sense of self. While modeled after his creator's lover Glariza to serve as his proxy in the Ten Commandments. Gowther received free will before helping his creator end the Holy War by rewriting Mael's identity. Gowther disappeared afterward, found centuries later in the cellar of Liones Castle by Bartra's sister Princess Nadja, whom Gowther fell in love with. While Nadja returned the sentiment, she died from an illness of the heart while resting against Gowther. In the manga, this was a result of the couple engaging in romantic relations together, after which Nadja expired. Gowther tried reviving her with his magic heart, a charm that he was told gives him his emotions, but it failed to resurrect her while making it appear that he had sadistically raped then murdered her. Gowther accepted the blame for his "crime of lust" out of guilt, discarding his magic heart to render himself emotionless to no longer feel the pain of losing Nadja. It was only after learning that King and Diane were searching for his magic heart that Gowther learned that it was only a placebo to begin with and begins accepting his emotions, allowing him to be more sociable while using his power to its full extent without trouble.</p>
<p>Gowther's special ability, Invasion, is a versatile ability that enables him to invade a person's mind and manipulate it in various ways that include memory alteration, forcing opponents to relive their worse moments, and telepathically relaying coordinated battle plans to his allies almost instantaneously. As a doll, Gowther has shown a high level of resilience to attacks normally fatal to humans like decapitation. His sacred treasure is Herritt, which takes the form of twin bows made of light which greatly enhances the spread and range of his Invasion. Like Hawk, Gowther is equipped with a Balor Power Eye that allows him to detect the overall power level of anyone in his vicinity.</p>

			<p>Merlin (マーリン, Mārin)
Voiced by: Maaya Sakamoto (Japanese); Lauren Landa (English)
Merlin is a cool and calculative member of the Deadly Sins who bears the Sin of Gluttony, symbolized by the Boar symbol tattooed above her neck, normally in the form of an attractive raven-haired woman in skimpy clothing, Merlin is a 3000-year-old witch known as the Daughter of Belialuin as her true name is unpronounceable by humans. Trained by her father the chief sage and the demon wizard Gowther, Merlin possessed vast magical potential and was raised as a weapon for her peoples' use against the higher ranking goddesses and demons. She fled Belialuin and crossed paths with Meliodas, with whom she fell in love, motivating her to assume an adult form and use a combination of the Infinity and Chrono Coffin (時の棺クロノ・コフィン, Kurono Kofin) spells to render herself an ageless immortal. She bore no animosity towards Meliodas and Elizabeth when they fell in love with each other, treating the latter like a sister. Merlin lives up to her sin with her obsession of filling the void in her heart when she learned of Chaos and resolves to release the entity from its seal, causing Belialuin's destruction when exploited the recruitment attempts of the Demon King and the Supreme Deity to increase her power with added immunity to their factions' powers.</p>
<p>After enlisting the giant Dabuzu to create the Coffin of Eternal Darkness in order to seal away the Demons and the Supreme Deity, Merlin wandered Brittania before reuniting with Meliodas and helping him establish the Seven Deadly Sins as a means to eliminate either the Demon King or the Supreme Deity to cause the imbalance needed for her agenda. When the Sins were accused of killing Zaratras, Merlin knocked Meliodas out to extract most of his power as a precautionary measure due to the wrath and destruction Meliodas released upon the death of one of Elizabeth's reincarnations. Before returning to the Sins, Merlin positioned herself as mentor to a young Arthur Pendragon. While on somewhat friendly terms with the other Deadly Sins, Merlin seemed to particularly enjoy Escanor's unrequited feelings for her. Following the death of the Demon King, having influenced events of the group's final battles by reactivating Elizabeth's reincarnation curse, Merlin reveals her true reasons for aiding the Sins when she conducts a ritual to resurrect Arthur as a vessel of Chaos. The other Sins felt betrayed after learning Merlin's story from the Lady of the Lake, but eventually forgive her with Melodias telling her to take responsibility for whatever results from her actions. In Four Knights of the Apocalypse, Merlin appears to remain by Arthur's side, allowing him to act on his whims even when being asked for advice. However, this Merlin is revealed to be a captive fairy changed into Merlin's image. When Guinevere points this out, Arthur kills the copy.</p>

			<p>Escanor (エスカノール, Esukanōru)
Voiced by: Tomokazu Sugita (Japanese); Kyle Hebert (English)
Escanor, a member of the Deadly who bears the Sin of Pride, epitomized by the Lion symbol tattooed on his back, the middle-aged Escanor was originally a prince of the Kingdom of Castellio until he was disowned and driven from his homeland due to his inability to control his monstrous strength, with a woman named Rosa helping him escape via the sea in a barrel. He had been traveling alone ever since, helping wherever he goes but driven off by fearful townsfolk. He later ended up joining the Seven Deadly Sins as their final member when he ended up in Liones, making him feel welcome as he fell in love with Merlin and later played a role in devastating Edinburgh Castle during the Deadly Sins' battle with the vampires. Following the group's disbandment, Escanor opened a secret tavern in the mountains where he remained until Ban found him by accident. Escanor rejoins the Deadly Sins soon after and, as a result of being gradually unable to withstand his own power, dies in the aftermath of the group's final battle against the Demon King.</p>
<p>For reasons unknown, Escanor acquired Archangel Mael's Grace Sunshine (太陽サンシャイン, Sanshain), which increases his physical strength depending on the position of the sun at the cost of making him overconfident. Escanor reaches his full power for one minute of noon when the sun is at its zenith, exceeding every living being on the planet as power incarnate known as "The One". Escanor can also use this ability to emit sunlight from his body so as to destroy nearly everything in close proximity. But like the other Graces, it gradually damages Escanor's body before continued use becomes harmful to him. Escanor's sacred treasure is Rhitta, a massive ornate one-handed axe with a crescent blade named after "the maiden loved by the sun". At night, he cannot even lift the weapon off the ground, but he can easily grasp with a single hand the moment it becomes dawn. He can summon Rhitta to his side at a moment's notice and is able to store sunlight within it for later use.</p>

			<p>Elizabeth Liones (エリザベス・リオネス, Erizabesu Rionesu)
Voiced by: Sora Amamiya[11] (Japanese); Erika Harlacher[12] (English)
Elizabeth Liones is originally from the Kingdom of Danafor before it was destroyed. She was adopted from Meliodas to Bartra Liones as the third princess of Liones.[13] She becomes an ally of the Seven Deadly Sins when seeking their help after the Great Holy Knights seized control of the kingdom, serving as a waitress in Meliodas' bar. Despite being frail and not a fighter, Elizabeth is very courageous and willing to protect others at the cost of her own health, like allowing Hendrickson to acquire her blood to free the Demon Race from the Coffin of Eternal Darkness. Still, being only a teenager, she is fairly gullible and easily influenced, often tricked by Meliodas' jokes. She doesn't seem to mind how often he caresses, molests, or harasses her sexually, however, and has even fallen in love with him due to a sense of familiarity with and nostalgia for him.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth is later revealed to be the 107th reincarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, known as Ella (Bloody Ellie in the English Dub of the anime) for her rarely seen violent streak before meeting Meliodas with their love causing the Holy War between their races. Elizabeth was killed near the war's end when she and Meliodas are attacked by their parents for their love, Elizabeth cursed by the Demon King to endlessly reincarnate as a human. The curse serves to torment Meliodas as Elizabeth would die within three days of regaining her powers and memories. In her current life, Elizabeth's latent power manifested in her ability to heal living things with tears from her right eye, manifesting more of her power in times of stress. Elizabeth eventually regains full memory of her previous incarnations and her full Goddess power is unleashed, activating her curse as the New Holy War is about to commence. This forces Meliodas to take a gambit of acquiring his father's power to break Elizabeth's curse, with Merlin briefly restoring the curse in secret as a means to force Meliodas to kill his father. Following the Sins disbanding, Elizabeth succeeds her father as queen of Liones with Meliodas as her husband.</p>

			<p>Hawk (ホーク, Hōku)
Voiced by: Misaki Kuno (Japanese); Cristina Vee (English)[9]
Hawk is a talking Gloucestershire old spots pig and Meliodas's pet/companion, introduced as the Boar Hat's 'captain of the Order of Scraps Disposal' as he eats disgusting table scraps. Hawk found Meliodas in a ditch sixteen years prior, and the two established a mobile bar together, having been together ever since. They often engage in harmless banter, with Hawk frequently seen scolding Meliodas for his perverted actions towards Elizabeth. Though mostly serving as comic relief by acting overly arrogant, he yet aids Elizabeth and the Sins several times, utilizing headbutts and other modest attacks on weaker enemies and transporting wounded allies. In the Kingdom Infiltration Arc, Hawk sacrifices himself to block a fatal attack of Hendrickson's aimed at Meliodas, and his death caused much anguish for Elizabeth and the Sins. But Hawk mysteriously revives from his remains as a piglet before regaining his normal size through excessive eating. Besides Meliodas, Hawk gets particularly well along with Ban and Merlin. Later, the latter equips him with a Balor Power Eye that allows him to detect the power level of anyone he sees. During his training in Istal, Hawk learns that he temporarily acquires the traits of whatever magical creature he eats, obtaining their powers until he digests them. It is later revealed that Hawk is a denizen of Purgatory and the younger brother of Wild, the latest of the creatures that the Demon King used as a means of spying on Meliodas from Purgatory.</p>
